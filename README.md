This repo contains the following:
- data/
- model/
- foodx.ipynb

The data directory simply contains the data csv file used in the foodx.ipynb file, while the model directory contains two pickle files (one for the final trained model that was created in foodx.ipynb, and another for a label encoder that was used in foox.ipynb).  As one might infer, the actual data analysis, model selection and training, etc. is performed in the foodx.ipynb file.  This notebook is designed to be "follow along", where markdown cells tell a story throughout the entirety of the file.  There are four main sections: analysis, implications, model selection/training/testing, and final discussion.
